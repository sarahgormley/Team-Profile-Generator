## Description

This Social Network API was created as a place for users to post thoughts and add friends. Users can also react to other people's thoughts and post their own. 

It was created using Inquirer for command line prompts, Node JS, and Jest for testing. 


## Installation
To install the dependencies required for this repository, please run the following command:

```
npm install jest

npm install --save inquirer@^8.0.0
```


## Usage
Make sure you download all the required packages.
Open the file in VS code and open the terminal and run the command to test the code:  
```
npm test
```
Once all tests have passed, in the command line, type:
```
node index.js
```
Once this has successfully run, Inquirer will prompt the user with a series of questions to add new employees.

Once all the employee's have been added, a HTML document will be generated.
